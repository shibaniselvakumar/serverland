# 🖥️ ServerLand

**Welcome to ServerLand** — an interactive sci-fi themed playground to master **server-side engineering** concepts like Routing, Middleware, Authentication, WebSockets, and more!

---

## 🚀 Overview

ServerLand turns backend learning into a fun and visual experience. Every major concept is presented as a level on a sci-fi map, helping students and developers **progressively unlock** server knowledge through a gamified interface.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- ⚡ **Fast Learning** — Bite-sized backend topics for quick understanding  
- 🧩 **Modular Topics** — Learn routing, middleware, auth, WebSockets, etc., separately  
- 🎮 **Interactive Progress** — Unlock new topics as you move forward  
- 🌐 **Real-world Skills** — Concepts directly map to Express.js backend building  

```
Here’s a polished and beginner-friendly **README.md** for your **ServerLand** project that clearly communicates the purpose, features, technologies used, and how to run it locally:
